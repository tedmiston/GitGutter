# Git Gutter (No Ads)

A [Sublime Text 2/3](http://www.sublimetext.com) plug-in to show information about files in a git repository.

This is a fork of [jisaacks/GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter) that removes commercial advertising.

If you use it, I encourage you to support the package maintainers in other ways, such as contributing PRs, fixing issues, or donating directly via Gratipay.

Install with `Package Control: Add Repository` and paste its url (https://github.com/tedmiston/GitGutter).
